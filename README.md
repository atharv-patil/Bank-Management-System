# Bank-Management-System
The main objective of the project is to develop online Banking
system for banks. There are many local banks where the banking work is
done manually. Users have to visit bank to Withdrawal or
Deposit amount. In present bank system it is also difficult to find
account information of account holder. In this bank management
system we will automate all the banking process. In our bank
management system user can check his balance online and he
can also transfer money to other account online. In this code
you can keep record for daily Banking transactions. The main
aim of developing bank management system is to design an
application, which could store bank  data and provide an
interface for retrieving customer related details with 100%
accuracy.
This bank management system also allow administrator to add new
customer account, delete account and administrator can also modify
existing user account information. Using this system user can

bank management system administrator can also check any translation in
any account. It also provides security check to reduce the possibility of
fraud. The system will check the user’s existence in the database
