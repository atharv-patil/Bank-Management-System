# Bank-Management-System

The Bank Management System project utilizes MySQL Connector (mysql.connector) to establish a connection with the MySQL database. The project involves creating a table called "BOB" to store account details, such as account number, name, phone, email, address, city, country, and balance.
<br>
The project incorporates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage bank accounts. It provides functionalities like inserting new account records, displaying records based on account number or sorting criteria, searching for account details, updating account information, and deleting accounts from the database.
<br>
The technology stack includes Python programming language for implementing the project logic and MySQL as the database management system. The mysql.connector library is used to establish a connection and execute SQL queries, while the cursor object is used to interact with the database and perform operations like fetching data, updating records, and deleting entries.
<br>
Overall, the project demonstrates the implementation of a basic bank management system using Python and MySQL, enabling users to perform account-related operations efficiently.
